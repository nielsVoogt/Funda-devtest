Hello there :)
--------------

Just a few easy steps to get this up and running locally:

- Clone repo and run `npm install` in the root folder  
Add the page to your localhost, and run `gulp sass`.
*Sidenote: The .css compiles in ./styling/css/ and is a symbolic link to ./web/css*

- For development run `gulp serve` in the root folder.
This will start browserSync and watch the .scss/.php/.html files for changes and reload accordingly
